# What is this page?
This page shows the raw data and R code to reproduce the figures in Hiki & Nakajima (2022, JWET). 


# Objective  
Microplastics adversely affect organisms through physical damage, inhibition of food assimilation, and/or toxicity of chemical leachates. To investigate the influence of feeding mode on microplastic ingestion by benthic organisms, we performed microplastic ingestion experiments using polystyrene microbeads (diameter: 4.1 and 20.6 Î¼m) and the estuarine benthic amphipod <i>Grandidierella japonica</i>, which can switch between filter-feeding and deposit-feeding modes.  
  
   
# Files
1. Rcode.md  
An example R code for analysis and visualization. This code requires an input dataset (i.e., "data.xlsx").  
     
2. Data_for_R_analysis_revised_GitHub_20220524.xlsx  
This dataset "Data_for_R_analysis_revised_GitHub_20220524.xlsx" includes the raw data about the number of microbeads ingested by an estuarine amphipod <i>Grandidierella japonica</i>.
  
3. Figs  
Figures generated from the R code.
